# Copilot Breakout Session

## Welcome to the world of GitHub Copilot ðŸ™‚

> [!Important]
> - Please use the Q&A section for asking your queries in the breakout section.
> - All attendees will be muted by deafult. Please raise your hand âœ‹ if you would like to discuss any topic and organizer of your room will unmute you.
> - Do not worry if you are not getting same response from GitHub Copilot as other members in the breakout room. We just have to reiterate the prompt based on the 4 pillars of the Prompt crafting, to get better results.
> - For each section, complete the exercises in the sequential order.

This repo contains sample code exercises, which can be tested using GitHub Copilot.

## Introduction Section

### Exercise 1
1. Generate documentation for the exercise1.cpp without using GitHub Copilot chat

> [!Tip]
> For this exercise, try to use GitHub Copilot code completion option.

### Exercise 2
1. Select exercise2.cpp and use GitHub Copilot Chat to understand the logic of the program. Generate the documentation and a README markdown file for the program.
2. Add atleast 2 additional features to the existing C++ program of exercise2.cpp using GitHub Copilot
3. Plan the unit testing of the additional features using GitHub Copilot
   
> [!Tip]
> - Run the exercises on your IDE and if you encounter any compilation errors, ask GitHub Copilot to understand about the errors in terminal
> - @terminal #terminalSelection fix or @terminal #terminalSelection explain 
> - You can also ask GitHub Copilot by expanding more on the prompt.

### Exercise 3

1. Translate the codebase you have created to C#, generate unit test cases for the code and corresponding documentation

### Exercise 4

3. Create a new C++ workspace, which will call an API from US National Weather Service to get the current temperature for a specific zipcode or city. The code should evaluate the temperate and identify the corresponding climate for that region.
